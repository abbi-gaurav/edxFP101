* week 1
** lect 0
*** FP is a style of programming in which expressions are more important than statements
*** we use expressions to compose and create bigger expressions
*** no mutation of a global state
*** lambda calculus by alonzo church
** lect 1
*** ghci
* week 2 Types and classes
** Types: collection of related values
** Type errors
** language can have
*** static typing: haskell
*** dynamic typing: ruby
*** no typing: javascript
** type inference
** basic types
*** Int : fixed precision
*** Integer: arbitrary precision
** List : same type arbitrary length
** Tuple : different types definite length
** curried functions
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell

#+END_SRC
** polymorphic functions
* week 3: Defining functions
** conditional expressions vs conditional statements
*** haskell has conditional expressions
**** need to have both if and else part like ternary expressions
*** java has conditional statements
** guarded equations
*** starts with an expression
** pattern matching
*** top -> botoom and left -> right
*** cannot repeat variables
*** x:xs must be (x:xs) because application has priority over :
** lamdba expressions
*** are expressions that denote functions
*** makes intent more clear
*** e.g without lambda
const :: a -> b -> a
const x _ = x
*** with lamddas
const :: a -> (b -> a)
const x = \ _ -> x
** sections
*** converts an infix operator to a curried function
*** e.g 1+2 =====> (+) 1 2
*** makes possible
**** (1+) 2
**** (+2) 1
**** 1 + 2
*** in general if ø is a binary operator, the
**** a ø b, (a ø) b and (ø b) a are possible
* week 4: List comprehensions
** helps write functions that manipulate lists
** e.g. [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
*** x <- [1..5] is called generator
*** comprehension can have multiple generators
**** [(x,y) | x <- [1..3], y <-[4..5]],
***** y is the inner loop
***** x is outer loop
***** this depends upon order of generators but not the expression
*** dependent generators
**** later generators can use the variables introduced by earlier generators
**** [(x,y)| x <- [1..3], y <- [x..5]]
*** guards are filters
**** [x | x <- [1..10], even x]
* week 5: HOF
** usefulness
*** common idioms  can be abstracted out
*** easy to define a DSL
*** algebaric properties of functions can be used to reason a about the behavior
** foldr is a homomorphism over list, i.e. structure of list is maintained
*** e.g. sum [1,2,3]
foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3]
foldr (+) 0 (1:(2:(3:[])))
replace each : with + and [] with 0
(1+(2+(3+0)))
*** is similiar to visitor pattern
*** usefulness
**** function properties can be proved using algebaric properties of foldr
**** fusion and banana split
**** advanced optimizations can be done
** functional composition
(.) :: (b ->c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
f.g = \x -> f (g x)
*** f.g = f after g
* week 7 Functional Parsers and Monads
** parser : a program that analyzes a piece of text to determine its syntactic structure
* week 9 Declaring Types and classes
** alias
*** type String = [Char]
*** type Pair a = (a,a)
*** *can be nested, but not recursive*
** Types
*** data Bool = True|False
**** Bool is siiliar to an abstract class or trait
**** True or False are sub-types classes, they are called data constructors
**** Type and constructors must begin with upper case
* week 11 Lazy evaluation

 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 | *facts            | innermost reduction                                           | outermost reduction*                 |
 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 |                   | may not always terminate                                      | may terminate where innermost cannot |
 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 | if both terminate | same result                                                   | result                               |
 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 |                   | more efficient as comapred to outermost, less number of steps |                                      |
** sharing of expressions
*** square (3+4) ====> (p * p), where p --> (3+4) ====> (p * p), where p = 7
** Lazy evaluation = outermost reduction + sharing
* Type constructors
- Type constructors take other types as parameters to eventually produce concrete types.
  - e.g ~Either, Maybe~ are type constructors
- This behavior is similar to that of functions, which take values as parameters to produce values.
- Types are little labels that values carry so that we can reason about the values.
** *But types have their own little labels called kinds*
  - A kind is more or less the type of a type.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  ,*Tree> :k Int
  Int :: *
#+END_SRC
- What does that * mean? It indicates that the type is a concrete type.
- A concrete type is a type that doesn’t take any type parameters.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  Maybe :: * -> *
#+END_SRC
- ~Maybe~ takes one concrete type and returns another concrete type
- *Type constructors are curried (just like functions), so we can partially apply them, as you can see here*
-
* compilation
- ghc
~ghc -o out/sum-file src/rwh/file-processing/SumFile.hs~
* Data.Map
- Map is strict in its keys, but nonstrict in its values.
- In other words, the spine, or structure, of the map is always kept up-to-date, but values in the map aren’t evaluated unless we force them to be.
- ~union~ is left-biased
* Parallel and concurrent programming
** ~modifyVar pattern~
- acquire a resource
- pass the resource to a compute
- *always* release the resource no matter what
- if there is an error, rethrow the error to the application
* recursion
** non-tail
** tail
- can be captured by ~foldl~
* pipes
** communicate
- ~yield~ : send output data
- ~await~ : receive input data
** components
- ~Producers~ : only yield
- ~Consumers~ : only await
- ~Pipes~     : can yield and await
- ~Effects~   : neither yield nor await
  - done connecting things when you get an Effect
* Functor
- how a single paramter function can be applied to a type class (Functor)
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- composistion
fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g

-- identity
fmap id == id

#+END_SRC

- ~(->) r~
  - The function type ~r ->a~ can be written as ~(->) r a~ similiar to ~2 + 3 == (+) 2 3~
  - ~(->)~ is a type constructor that takes ~r~ and ~a~
  - To make it ~functor~ we can partially apply ~(->) r~ which is ~(r ->)~
  - to make function as functor
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  instance Functor ((->) r) where
    fmap f g = (\x -> f (g x))
    -- fmap = (.) this is function composition

    -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b.
    -- fmap :: (a -> b) ((->) r a) -> ((-> r) b) == (a -> b) -> (r -> a) (r -> b)
#+END_SRC

- **lift**
  - =fmap= takes a function,lifts it so that it can be applied on a functor
* Applicative Functor
- A type class which enables us to raise a function to act on multiple Functor values
- when we have a function that takes multiple values
- are closed under composition
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  class (Functor f) => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f(a->b) -> f a -> f b
#+END_SRC

- functions are applicative functors
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  instance Applicative ((->) r) where
    pure x = (\_ -> x)        --pure :: a -> (r -> a)
    f <*> g = \x -> f x (g x) -- let f = (+) <$> (*2) <*> (+10) ; f 3 = 19
#+END_SRC

* Monad
- a type constructor ~m~
- a chaining function ~ma -> (a -> mb) -> mb~
- a injector ~a -> ma~
- bind in a way that includes an "accumulator".
  - This contrasts with applicatives, which have no accumulator and hence no communication between arguments.
- not closed under composition

- =(->) r= is a monad
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  instance Monad ((->) r) where
    return x = \_ -> x           -- return :: a -> (r -> a)
    h >>= f = \w -> f (h w) w
#+END_SRC 

* Reader
- reader monad allows us to treat functions as values with a context. 
* Monad transformers
* Arrows
- compose pure and monadic functions together in a uniform simple fashion.
- abstract away the knowledge of monads from the user
- useful in parsers, streaming applications, and as an approach to functional reactive programming.
