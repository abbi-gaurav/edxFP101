* week 1
** lect 0
*** FP is a style of programming in which expressions are more important than statements
*** we use expressions to compose and create bigger expressions
*** no mutation of a global state
*** lambda calculus by alonzo church
** lect 1
*** ghci
* week 2 Types and classes
** Types: collection of related values
** Type errors
** language can have
*** static typing: haskell
*** dynamic typing: ruby
*** no typing: javascript
** type inference
** basic types
*** Int : fixed precision
*** Integer: arbitrary precision
** List : same type arbitrary length
** Tuple : different types definite length
** curried functions
** polymorphic functions
* week 3: Defining functions
** conditional expressions vs conditional statements
*** haskell has conditional expressions
**** need to have both if and else part like ternary expressions
*** java has conditional statements
** guarded equations
*** starts with an expression
** pattern matching
*** top -> botoom and left -> right
*** cannot repeat variables
*** x:xs must be (x:xs) because application has priority over :
** lamdba expressions
*** are expressions that denote functions
*** makes intent more clear
*** e.g without lambda
const :: a -> b -> a
const x _ = x
*** with lamddas
const :: a -> (b -> a)
const x = \ _ -> x
** sections
*** converts an infix operator to a curried function
*** e.g 1+2 =====> (+) 1 2
*** makes possible
**** (1+) 2
**** (+2) 1
**** 1 + 2
*** in general if ø is a binary operator, the
**** a ø b, (a ø) b and (ø b) a are possible
* week 4: List comprehensions
** helps write functions that manipulate lists
** e.g. [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
*** x <- [1..5] is called generator
*** comprehension can have multiple generators
**** [(x,y) | x <- [1..3], y <-[4..5]],
***** y is the inner loop
***** x is outer loop
***** this depends upon order of generators but not the expression
*** dependent generators
**** later generators can use the variables introduced by earlier generators
**** [(x,y)| x <- [1..3], y <- [x..5]]
*** guards are filters
**** [x | x <- [1..10], even x]
**** 
* week 5: HOF
** usefulness
*** common idioms  can be abstracted out
*** easy to define a DSL
*** algebaric properties of functions can be used to reason a about the behavior
** foldr is a homomorphism over list, i.e. structure of list is maintained
*** e.g. sum [1,2,3]
foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3]
foldr (+) 0 (1:(2:(3:[])))
replace each : with + and [] with 0
(1+(2+(3+0)))
*** is similiar to visitor pattern
*** usefulness
**** function properties can be proved using algebaric properties of foldr
**** fusion and banana split
**** advanced optimizations can be done
** functional composition
(.) :: (b ->c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
f.g = \x -> f (g x)
*** f.g = f after g
* week 7 Functional Parsers and Monads
** parser : a program that analyzes a piece of text to determine its syntactic structure
** functor
*** fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
*** it is a computational context
* week 9 Declaring Types and classes
** alias
*** type String = [Char]
*** type Pair a = (a,a)
*** *can be nested, but not recursive*
** Types
*** data Bool = True|False
**** Bool is siiliar to an abstract class or trait
**** True or False are sub-types classes, they are called data constructors
**** Type and constructors must begin with upper case
* week 11 Lazy evaluation

 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 | *facts            | innermost reduction                                           | outermost reduction*                 |
 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 |                   | may not always terminate                                      | may terminate where innermost cannot |
 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 | if both terminate | same result                                                   | result                               |
 |-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
 |                   | more efficient as comapred to outermost, less number of steps |                                      |
** sharing of expressions
*** square (3+4) ====> (p * p), where p --> (3+4) ====> (p * p), where p = 7
** Lazy evaluation = outermost reduction + sharing
* Type constructors
- Type constructors take other types as parameters to eventually produce concrete types.
  - e.g ~Either, Maybe~ are type constructors
- This behavior is similar to that of functions, which take values as parameters to produce values.
- Types are little labels that values carry so that we can reason about the values.
** *But types have their own little labels called kinds*
  - A kind is more or less the type of a type.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  ,*Tree> :k Int
  Int :: *
#+END_SRC
- What does that * mean? It indicates that the type is a concrete type.
- A concrete type is a type that doesn’t take any type parameters.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  Maybe :: * -> *
#+END_SRC
- ~Maybe~ takes one concrete type and returns another concrete type
- *Type constructors are curried (just like functions), so we can partially apply them, as you can see here*
